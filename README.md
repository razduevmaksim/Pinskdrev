## About

A mobile client can help an enterprise grow its audience. Many people use mobile devices to search for products and services, so having a mobile client can attract new customers and increase sales. A mobile client can also help a business improve the customer experience. Customers will be able to quickly and easily find the right product, view its characteristics and price, and contact the store representatives in case of questions.

Having a mobile client is very useful for an enterprise, as it will allow you to meet customer needs and increase sales.

The principle of operation of the mobile client is as follows: the user opens the application and views the proposed assortment. The user adds the products he likes to the cart and places an order, during the execution of which, he will need to fill out a questionnaire. Next, the order is sent to the administrator, who processes the order.
